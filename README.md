## OSTI API
This python script is a simple GET request using the open OSTI API. Please note that the parameter "identifer" is neccessary to look up Report Numbers, OSTI IDs, etc., but it is not mentioned in the official documentation. After retrieving the records in JSON format, I used OpenRefine to clean the data and export to CSV.
